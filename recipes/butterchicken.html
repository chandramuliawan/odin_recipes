    <h5><i>aka how to cook 'em</i></h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Diced the chicken in, um, bit sized pieces as preferred</li>
        <li>Use the minced garlic, and some crushed ginger if you like, and add the yogurt and the seasonings into the chicked. Rub them good, and let is sit for <b>4 hours</b> at the very least. <small>left it overnight sounds cool too! let them sleep tight in the fridge yo!</small></li>
        <li>After the chicken is well rested, we can start cook the thing! Start by melting your butter!</li>
        <li>After the butter is <i>hot and ready</i>, add the onions. <small>hint: if you have more garlic, we can add them along with the onion as well!</small></li>
        <li>Soon as the onions are <b>golden and caramelised,</b> add the chicken into the pot!</li>
        <li>Make sure the chicken is well cooked in all direction and side! <small>You are welcome to cooked the chicken beforehand and/or in separate pot, if you like.</small></li>
        <li>After all the chicken is juiced up, add the crushed tomatoes. This crushed tomatoes will act as <b>the sauce</b> of the dish. So you can add more or add less to your liking!</li>
        <li>Since all the ingredients are all cooked, all that's left is to left the sauce to simmer. Just stop when we arrived at the consistency that suites your liking!</li>   
    
    </ol>
